This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to logical indexing on empty arrays. The function `myFunction.m` shows a scenario where logical indexing is performed without checking for an empty array resulting in an unexpected error. The solution in `bugSolution.m` shows how to correctly handle the empty case to prevent this error.  The issue arises when a logical index is applied to an array that is empty; standard MATLAB practice often overlooks this edge case. The solution adds a check for an empty array before performing any operations that might fail on an empty input.
